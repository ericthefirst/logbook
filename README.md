# logbook
Inspired by /Steal Like an Artist/, a logbook app to record your victories.

If you put this on your website, you should absolutely learn how [htaccess](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/cets/answers/auth-htpasswd.html) works and use it in the upload/ directory.  Otherwise, who knows what people might put into your log?  Another option is to put it in the root logbook directory, to keep the whole thing private.
